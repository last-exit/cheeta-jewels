      <Section no="01" title="The contract">
        <p>
          A contract of sale is formed when we dispatch your order, not at
          checkout. Until dispatch, we may cancel and refund an order if a
          stock or pricing error is identified, or if a fraud check flags
          the transaction.

      <Section no="02" title="Pricing & currency">
        <p>
          Prices on the site are shown in AED and are inclusive of UAE VAT
          where applicable. International orders are shown exclusive of
          duties and import taxes, which are calculated at checkout where
          supported.

      <Section no="04" title="Title & risk">
        <p>
          Title to the goods passes to you on dispatch. Risk passes on
          delivery. Until delivery, the piece is insured by the house.
